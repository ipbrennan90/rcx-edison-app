Thanks to Esther Jun Kim for the edi-cam project which I pulled from to get the edison camera stream working, you can find that here:

Her tutorials on her blog were really amazing as well, if you are at all interested in getting started
with edison I recommend reading all of her related posts at http://drejkim.com/



edi-cam demonstrates live video streaming on Intel Edison using Node.js and WebSockets. Audio is not supported at the moment. See the demo in action [here](http://youtu.be/nVDL2-bFT3Y).
